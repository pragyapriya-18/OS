ðŸ”¹ What is VirtualBox?
VirtualBox is a free and open-source software program, developed by Oracle. 
It allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer at the same time â€” 
like running Linux on a Windows machine without affecting your main OS.

It's like having a computer inside your computer. That "computer" is called a virtual machine (VM).
