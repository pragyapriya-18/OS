SYSTEM CALL fork():

Explanation:
The fork() system call is used to create a new process by coping the parent process. 
After calling fork(), two processes are created: the parent process and the child process. 
The parent Process is the original process and 
the child process is a copy of the parent but has a unique process ID (PID). 
Both processes continue execution from the next instruction.

Return Value:
* Parent Process: Returns the PID of the child.
*Child Process: Returns 0.

Usage: 
Used to perform multitasking.
Itâ€™s mainly used in Unix/Linux systems for process creation 
such as executing a program, handling requests, etc.

Syntax: fork();

Example:

int main() {
    if (fork() == 0) {
        printf("Child Process\n");
    } 
    else {
        printf("Parent Process\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
